# 🛠️ Kire’s 100 Days of Code Challenge

## Main Commitment  
**I will code for at least 1 hour every day for 100 days — no tutorials, no fluff — just real projects and real growth.**

**Start Date:** June 3, 2025

---

## My Rules  
1. I’ll post daily updates on **Bluesky** using the hashtag `#100DaysOfCode`.  
2. Work stuff doesn’t count. This challenge is for me and my future.  
3. I’ll push code to GitHub every day (even if it’s small).  
4. I’ll log my progress in [`log.md`](log.md) — including links to commits, posts, or screenshots.  
5. I’ll focus on **real projects**, not tutorials. I’m here to make things, not just watch videos.

## How I’m Keeping It Sustainable  
1. Every day’s log will include a commit, screenshot, or link to my Bluesky post.  
2. If I get stuck, I’ll breathe, then read this: [Learning to Code: When It Gets Dark](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learning-to-code-when-it-gets-dark-e485edfb58fd/)  
3. I’m building instead of binging tutorials — here’s why: [How to Get a Developer Job in Less Than a Year](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-get-a-developer-job-in-less-than-a-year-c27bbfe71645/)  
4. If I can't push code that day (life happens), I’ll still log *something* to stay accountable.  
5. Also: markdown practice counts as a win 💅
