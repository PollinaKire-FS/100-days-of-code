# 100 Days of Code â€“ Log

tracking daily progress so I can see how far Iâ€™ve come

### Day 0: June 2, 2025 (setup day)

**Todayâ€™s Progress**

- created my GitHub repo
- added `README.md`, `rules.md`, and this log
- picked a few starter projects

**Thoughts**  
Getting organized felt good. Iâ€™m ready to build.

### Day 1 â€“ June 3, 2025

**Todayâ€™s Progress**  
Built a simple meal generator called _girl dinner_. Used a JS array and `Math.random()` inside a function to show random snack-style meals when a button is clicked. Styled it with CSS and deployed it on GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts**  
It felt good to start small. Iâ€™ve been back in tech for a year but havenâ€™t built anything just for me until now.
