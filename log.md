### Day 0: June 2, 2025 (setup day)

**Todayâ€™s Progress**

- created my GitHub repo
- added `README.md`, `rules.md`, and this log
- picked a few starter projects

**Thoughts**  
Getting organized felt good. Iâ€™m ready to build.

### Day 1 â€“ June 3, 2025

**Todayâ€™s Progress**  
Built a simple meal generator called _girl dinner_. Used a JS array and `Math.random()` inside a function to show random snack-style meals when a button is clicked. Styled it with CSS and deployed it on GitHub Pages.

**Thoughts**  
It felt good to start small. Iâ€™ve been back in tech for a year but havenâ€™t built anything just for me until now.

### Day 2 â€“ June 4, 2025

**Todayâ€™s Progress**  
Connected to the Bluesky API using @atproto/api. Logged in with an app password, fetched my latest post, and printed the text, date, and image URL in the terminal. Created a Node script to save the post data as a local post.json file so the browser can fetch and display it later. It's throwing some errors, but that's a problem for tomorrow.

**Thoughts**  
I hit some snags with ES modules vs. CommonJS and browser imports, but now I get why that distinction matters.

### Day 3 â€“ June 6, 2025

**Todayâ€™s Progress**

I wiped and restarted the cover page repo four times. There were Git conflicts and the wrong GitHub account and all the things. I might have cried for a minute. I have the cover page styled now, and I got wrangler installed and Cloudflare and ATProto is talking. Next I will inject my post to the page!
